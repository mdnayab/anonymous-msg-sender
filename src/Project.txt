1.  Install Mongoose
    First we create model (User.ts), in which:
    a. Message model:
    We firstly define TYPE of message using interface which is extended by document (L:3).
    Then, we define models of message and also define its type because we use TypeScript(L:8).

    b.User model:
    Same with user model, firstly define TYPE of message using interface which is extended by document (L:20).
    Then, we define models of user and also define its type because we use TypeScript(L:31).

    Lastly, export the user model.

2.  Install Zod (Folder: schema)
    We make schemas (signUpSchema.ts, signInSchema.ts, ...) for adding the validations using "Zod" library.

3. DB connection (Folder: lib)
    1stly we define the TYPE of connection (L:3).
    Then, we check the db is already connected or not? (L:10).
    Then, we try to connect the db (L:15).

4. Email verification
    Install resend, react-email
    First, we import Resend in separate file (resend.ts) using secret api key and export it by storing in resend "varaible".
    Then, we need to make a template of sending email (src/emails/VerificationEmails.tsx).
    We also need to declare a type/template of Api response (src/types/ApiResponse.ts) for ease in returning the response.
    Lastly, we make a function for sending email (src/helpers/sendVerificationEmails.ts).

5. Signup
    Install bycryptjs
    Firstly connect the DB
    Then destructure in data from response
    Then we check username is exist and verified or not? (L:12)
    Then we check email is already exist or not? (L:29)
    If exist
        Then we check existing email is verified or not? (L:30)
        If verified then throw msg:"User already exist with this email"(L:34)
        Else save the info in user model.(L:45)
    Else We store the info in User model.(L:63)
    Then take email, username and verifycode and send verification email to user. (L:66)
    If user confirm the verification then show the msg:"User registered successfully. Please berify your email" (L:85)
    Otherwise, False the success and show the msg from emailResponse.message. (L:76)
